## WHAT IS IT?
The general purpose of BEEMOVE-ABM is: to model how structurally distinct agro-natural landscapes based in BEEFOR-ABM affect bee communities based on their ability to survive, reproduce and disperse.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
The ODD protocol will be available in the RLdaSS et al., 2022 thesis of the Federal University of Bahia, Brazil. We recommend that any publication based on the use of BEEMOVE-ABM shall includes, in the Supplementary Material, the NetLogo file itself that was used and all input files. If you change these codes, we recommend documenting the changes in full detail and providing a revised description of the ODD model.

## CREDITS AND REFERENCES
If you mention this model or the NetLogo software in a publication, we ask that you include the citations below. For the model itself: RLdaSS et al., 2022: doctoral thesis from the Federal University of Bahia, Brazil, entitled: Effect of Landscape Heterogeneity on Bee Populations and Communities.
